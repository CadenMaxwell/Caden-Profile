This position would allow me to express my skills in a software development
environment, and I will be able to work with a large group in software design
and development, coding, contributing to product design and providing
technical leadership. Not only will I be able to do my own thing in creating
software but also be able to help guide others with their endeavours.
The skills required for this role is communication between my peers,
extensive knowledge in different coding languages like; C#, HTML5, CSS and
Java. The job application doesn’t say anything about qualifications or
experience. However, the job is very high paying ($200,000) and would require a
lot of experience in this industry.
To acquire experience for this job, I would need to graduate with a degree in
IT as well as working in an IT industry. If graduation doesn’t suffice enough,
then I will have to work outside of University both in an IT industry and as
well as learning other coding languages so I would be ready to handle the kind
of work that this job would require.
