I’m quite content with the personality and creativity test. However, the
learning style test didn’t seem to be as accurate. I find that I am more of a
visual learner than an auditory learner, a lot of things go over my head if I
don’t have anything to view. The rest of the test results seemed accurate,
and I can identify with them, more introverted than extraverted, logical
thinking and using observations over intuitive thinking.
The results show that I can look at problems and overcome them from a
knowledgeable and mature point of view, I know from experience that I work
well in team environments and can help fix any issues either with the work or
with the people. The test results show that I am capable of accomplishing
these team skills and that I will work well in a team environment. I am
relatively easy-going when it comes to forming teams and the people in my
group, as long as everyone puts the work in, works together and listens to
what everyone has to say.
