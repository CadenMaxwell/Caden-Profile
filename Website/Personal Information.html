I was born in Sydney, and then I moved to Tumut for three years later I moved to
Wagga where I live today. My Dad is from New Zealand, and my Mum is Australian.
I have just completed High School and my HSC, where the focus of my studies
were IT-related subjects. This included; Information and Digital Technology,
Software Design and Development and Information Processes and Technology,
during these studies, I also worked towards achieving my Cert III for IT. I
used to play a lot of tennis since I was 11 years old up to the end of high
school, my hobbyâ€™s now are mostly playing games, hanging out with my friends
and on the odd occasion, stream on twitch.
