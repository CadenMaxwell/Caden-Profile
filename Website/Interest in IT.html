Since I was two years old, I would play video games with my parents, and
since then I have always had an interest in gaming, as I got older I got
newer game consoles until I got my own gaming PC, this is how my interest
in IT increased. I started playing around with computers and different
software. I used to own a youtube channel where I would edit videos,
using a range of editing software, I also got into making text-based
adventure games using batch. I got very familiar with computers and
technology and started the IT VET subject in year 9.
I chose RMIT because, for me, it had the best IT course over other
universities, it was very hands-on when it came to the learning, and it
incorporated both IT and Software Development in the course.
During my studies at RMIT, I expect to have a more in-depth knowledge of the
IT world, an understanding I will be able to bring into a career later in
life. I hope to be able to learn what it is like to be surrounded in an IT
environment with other like-minded individuals.
