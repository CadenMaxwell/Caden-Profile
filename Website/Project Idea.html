<h1 style="color: #262626">Overview</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">
My project is going to be a discord bot that can not only manage a discord
server but also have some fun and interactable features. There are a lot of
server managing discord bots already and some fun bots, but I want to be able
to combine them both as well as being able to have my own customisations the way
I want it to be.
</div>

<h1 style="color: #262626">Motivation</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">
The reason as to why I want to make this bot is because I run a discord server
for my friends and I’m always looking for new ways to add some fun to the
discord or to be able to manage it better so everything can run smoothly, there
are heaps of bots out there that are public and free. However, most of them do
too much that it becomes unnecessary and hard to understand, or the ‘fun’
things they can do aren’t that fun or funny, I’ve also tried to make a bot
before and had limited knowledge so I would like to tackle it again
</div>

<h1 style="color: #262626">Description</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">
The main feature but the smaller part of this bot will be discord management;
this will cover some simple management tasks. Like timing out spamming, adding
new members to a primary role, Notification on suspicious activity, this
includes all caps, links, invites, mentions and spamming Emojies, repeated text
and spoilers. Because I am using this bot on a private server, I don’t want it
to be too harsh, so instead of banning, kicking, muting or timing out members,
it will only send a notification in a private chat. I the server owner will be
the only one who can see these messages, and I will deem if the member needs to
stop being annoying or if they are just having some harmless fun.
There are a lot of discord bots out there that do many different things, some
you can catch, trade and fight pokemon, some you can make memes with, some you
can have conversations or sing songs with, I want to be able to have this bot
be able to do these sort of fun things that are more curated to my friends and
me. We do somethings outside of the discord like our Minecraft server, or
sometimes we will stream a movie, and all watch it together, the bot will be
able to announce unique things for those events. The bot could advertise the
server so some people who haven’t joined, can. Or the person who is streaming
the movie could set an event to the next time we play a film.
A fun idea I had about the bot was that it would be able to play a song from
youtube and then as it was playing it would print out the lyrics to the song in
a separate chat. There are music bots that can play songs and get lyrics from
the internet, but none of them time the lyrics to the song, this could be
difficult to get the timing right. It would only work with songs of my choice,
but it would be a fun feature to add to the discord.

<h1 style="color: #262626">Tools and Technology</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Eclipse IDE</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Discord</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Digital Ocean / Spare Computer</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">Eclipse is a Java Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) which allows you to code in Java and run java programs.
This will allow me to code the bot in Java and run it for testing. To be
able to test the bot to see if it is doing what I expect it to do. To be
able to keep this bot running once it is released it needs to be continually
running, this can be completed through a discord bot server hoster called
Digital Ocean which I can pay for or I can have it run on a spare computer
24/7 for free.

<h1 style="color: #262626">Skills Required</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Java</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Server Hosting</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">•	Basic Computer Knowledge</div>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">Server hosting and computer skills are pretty simple;
I’ve hosted many servers before. I have worked with them in the past, and as
this is an IT course and I have heaps of experience with computers, I should be
able to check off the basic computer knowledge. Java, however, will be a bit
tricky, I have previous expertise with coding in Python, but I thought I would
do it Java as it is a better programming language for these bots. Also, I am
doing the introduction to programming course where we are learning Java so it
would be good practise to use this language.
</div>

<h1 style="color: #262626">Outcome</h1>
<div class="split left" style="color: #d6d6d6">If the project is successful, then I will have a
personalised discord bot that I can run on my server, to both add
functionality and fun to the server. It will serve as a manager and also for
some fun jokes. It will be entirely custom for how I want it to be. By making
this bot, it solves the problem I have with conventional bots that others
have made. It will be accustomed to what I want and what I need for my server,
and it will make managing and bringing fun to the server much more manageable.
